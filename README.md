# Riggrats add on

Allows you to save a rig and rig animation to .json files.


To install, navigate to Blender's `Edit > Preferences > Add-Ons > Install`.

Install the `save_rig.py` file when prompted.



To use, make sure you're in object mode, and have already created an armature as well as attached it to a mesh. 

Navigate to `Object > Save Rig To Json` and you're good to go.


Still very much in development, with hopefully new features being added as they're needed.
